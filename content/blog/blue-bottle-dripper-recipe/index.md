For the last two years I've been oscillating between my ceramic Kalita 185 and my Blue Bottle dripper. In the last 6 months I've landed on the blue bottle dripper for daily use. It allows for better flow through the coffee bed and seems to encourage more turbulence.

Blue bottle sells bamboo filters for the dripper that have no paper taste and technically don't need to be preheated. They also provide freer flow compared to traditional paper filters. I really like them but they are a bit too expensive for use every day. Kalita 185 filters work almost as well with the dripper albeit with a slighlty slower flow rate. This recipe should work with any compatible filter.
