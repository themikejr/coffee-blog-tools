description: "Coffee changed the world."

Coffee is an interesting food that [probably changed the course of history in the west](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/the-lost-world-of-the-london-coffeehouse). Coffee became a part of my own life at a time of change as well.

This will be a place to post my own reference material for my coffee roasting, brewing, and tasting escapades.

Stay tuned.
