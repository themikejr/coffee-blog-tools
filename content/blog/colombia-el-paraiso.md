## About the Coffee

Roasted and sold by Blue Bottle, this was an 'exceedingly rare' coffee that they offered for a limited time. Most interestingly, it featured an expierimental fermentation technique:

> From a highly experimental producer in Colombia, this coffee brings together two microtrends: an initial fermentation without oxygen and a second fermentation that includes the addition of specific yeasts. The wild result combines the intense fruitiness of natural processing with the clean flavors and complex acidity we associate with washed processing.

## The Tasting

Brewed with my [daily driver brewing technique](https://coffee.themikejr.com/blue-bottle-dripper-recipe/).

### Nose

As I was brewing it, I was continually overwhelmed with a very fresh raspberry jam smell.
It smelled so specifically like raspberry jam. The only other coffee I've enjoyed that smelled like this was a Yemeni coffee that had earlier this year from [Madcap Detroit](https://madcapcoffee.com/2019/03/29/detroitgrandopening/).
In the cup, the raspberry jam note remained and was accompanied by cinnamon, cantaloupe, and perhaps a very faint savory/yeasty bread smell.

### Mouth

When tasting, this coffee had at least two very clear "stages", or different sets of flavors and sensations that wash over the palate sequentially.
First,  it hits with a very intense and fresh fruit: definitely reminiscent of the aforementioned raspberry jam, but it also with a gentle spice like that of mango.
As the fruit melts away from your tongue, the second stage appears from seemingly nowhere and is mainly characterized by a somewhat heavy body. This medium-heavy body comes with very sweet and smooth flavors of cantaloupe and mild chocolate.
As the viscous body leaves, tart tongue-pulling acidity from the fruit comes back and leaves you wanting another sip.

As the cup cools, the fruit becomes more focused and slightly bitter, more like cranberry than raspberry.

## Some Thoughts

Coffees from Colombia doesn't usually taste like this. I suppose that there will be a camp, that similarly to naturally processed coffees, doesn't like the fact that the terroir is hidden in favor of exaggerated and interesting flavors that are the result of processing. For me though, this was an interesting and enjoyable cup. I say bring on the experimentation!
